# Day 18: Thanks, BFS!

What a nice surprise - an easy day this late! Part 1 was just BFS (I fucked myself with getting grid dimensions wrong and had an unsolveable grid, lol), and Part 2 was totally fine with brute-force iteration.

I took a long pause from AOC - 12/17 is when my big ski trip started, and I skied from 12/17 - 12/23 in Vermont. Then Christmas, and then I just chilled with my partner. Then in the new year, I wasn't feeling too keen immediately for AOC, and if I've learned anything, it's not to force myself to do work if I'm not excited about it - just find a peripheral but novel enough approach to tackle similiar subject matter. For me, that was reading Skiena's Algorithm Design Handbook and starting on Neetcode 150. Now I'm back.
