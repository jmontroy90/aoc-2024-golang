# Day 20: I guess I just BFS now

This was also pretty straight-forward. More BFS - I'ma be so good at BFS if I keep doing AOC.

To be accurate, the first part wasn't BFS - or, it was, where the queue is just "the only next available step".

The second part was BFS to determine the good cheats, checking for duplicates and early-exits. I got snagged by not including the time of the cheat itself, which I imagine is a frequent snag.
